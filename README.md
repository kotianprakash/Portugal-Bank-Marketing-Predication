# Conclusion

### Target Audience

The campaign impact was good for customers aged between 18-25 and 60-70. The following campaign advertisement should take into account the target groups. Also, the company needs to investigate why the same month has more impact on the campaign. For example, it may harm the customers. On the other hand, the summer months and October positively impact the campaign. So it should be better to start a new campaign advertisement in summer and autumn.
